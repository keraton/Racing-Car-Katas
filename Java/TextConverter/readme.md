* UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter exercise: write the unit tests for the UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter class.

The UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter class is designed to reformat a plain text file for display in a browser. For the Python and Java versions, there is an additional class "HtmlPagesConverter" which is slightly harder to get under test. It not only converts text in a file to html, it also supports pagination. It's meant as a follow up exercise.
